 * Priority Queue Rules for Checked-In Patients
 * 
 * Priority levels:
 * - Priority "1": Highest priority (urgent cases) - displayed first
 * - Priority "2": Medium priority (standard cases) - displayed second  
 * - Priority "3": Lowest priority (routine cases) - displayed last
 * 
 * Sorting criteria (in order of importance):
 * 1. Priority level: Lower number = higher priority (1 > 2 > 3)
 * 2. Check-in time: When priorities are equal, earlier check-in time takes precedence
 * 
 * Example sorting order:
 * - Patient A: Priority 1, checked in 09:00 (1st)
 * - Patient B: Priority 1, checked in 09:30 (2nd) 
 * - Patient C: Priority 2, checked in 08:45 (3rd)
 * - Patient D: Priority 2, checked in 09:15 (4th)
 * 
 * - Patients in "checkedIn" status are automatically sorted by these criteria
 * - First patient in the sorted list is marked as "next to be attended"
 * - Drag-and-drop operations maintain priority+time sorting when patients move to checkedIn
